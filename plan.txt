Understanding the problem:
    I need to create a library that stores an array of books all created as objects.
    These objects will appear on a webpage with cards displaying info for each book.
    The user will be able to add books, remove books and mark whether or not they have read that book yet.

Plan
-------
Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have?
    Yes. The interface will be in the form of a webpage that displays cards with the info for each book in the library.
    The user will be able to add books from a form that populates when they press a button on the page. 
    Each card will have the option to remove a book or mark whether or not they have read a book.
What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?

What's the desired input?

Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
